# Networking-Fundamentals-from-Akamai-Technical-Academy


This repo has the end results of my capstone project. The goal was to create a SOHO network using packet tracer and a presentation decribing your netowrk design. 


### Pre-requisite:


Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.2.2. 


You can download Cico's packet tracer in Skills for all:

 About this Course

Students start by learning basic network theory and terminology including network components, node functions, types of networks and network models. Students will gain an understanding of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and the TCP/IP Model including encapsulation and common network protocols. Students learn about data transmission methods and ethernet including CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA. The course covers wired and wireless networking standards, and networking hardware including switches and routers. Students will gain a thorough understanding of TCP/IP including binary numbers, CIDR notation, ANDing, and configuring routes in a network using routers and NAT routers. Students learn to configure DHCP and DNS, and then examine regulating traffic between network zones including implementing a DMZ, and using IDS/IPS technology, and configuring VPNs. The course includes a thorough discussion of troubleshooting wired and wireless networks including using packet sniffers. Students will use software that will allow them to simulate sophisticated networks to achieve practical experience. The course ends with a capstone that students will complete to demonstrate mastery of course objectives.

### Capstone

In this module, the student will upload a capstone project that demonstrates mastery of the material.
2 videos

I Create a file in Packet Tracer to demonstrate the proposed “company” network. Include a minimum of two client machines. The two machines must be able to ping each other by IP address.

    Include whatever networking equipment called for in your plan.

        Router(s)

        Switch(es)

    Include any servers required to provide the services needed on your internal network.

    Include the public web server.

    Configure the clients and infrastructure so that they can access the company web page from the LAN.

    Include an external client and configure it so that it can access the company web page from the “Internet”. The web server should be accessed using a URL of http://www.company.com.

    You do not need to include every device in your plan but feel free to include sample devices for demonstration purposes.

    For example, if each employee will have a printer, you only need to provide one printer.

    Many of the devices can be found in the End Devices: End Devices section in Packet Tracer.

    Provide whatever devices are necessary to demonstrate the technology you have chosen.
    

II Oral Presentation or PowerPoint

You may record an oral presentation or create a PowerPoint presentation. If you choose an oral presentation, the length should be no more than ten minutes of recorded video. An oral presentation does not have to be perfect. You’re not being evaluated on your ability to edit video. If there are speaking mistakes, that’s ok. You can also choose to combine both solutions and record your PowerPoint with a voiceover.

The oral presentation or the PowerPoint must include the following:

The name of your company.

A discussion of the internal network you have designed and an explanation of the reasons behind your choices.

If you chose an oral presentation, pan to the Packet Tracer file you created. You can also draw on a white board if you want. If you chose PowerPoint, include a screenshot of your Packet Tracer solution.

You do not need to show every single device configuration. Include the devices and configurations that are relevant to your network.
